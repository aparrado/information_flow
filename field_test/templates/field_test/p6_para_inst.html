    <p>
For this task you will have 5 minutes to read a story, which is enough time to read it twice. After the 5 minutes pass, you will be asked to solve two puzzles. When you finish solving the puzzles, you will proceed to the next screen, where you will be asked to retell the story as if you were telling it to a friend. As you are reading, imagine how you will retell the story to your friend, making sure to remember as many details as possible. Your focus should be to retell the story as faithfully as possible.
